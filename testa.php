                    <p class="doug_text">When I began my instrument training and was looking for an exceptional CFII, Aaron stood out as a knowledgeable and accessible instructor at the Palo Alto airport. Aaron's knowledgeable and careful explanation of the important theoretical knowledge required to be a successful instrument pilot worked well with my learning style. His ability to relate the ground knowledge with in-flight practical application (lesson-by-lesson) really helped reinforce both the knowledge and skills required to be a proficient and safe instrument pilot. Aaron's ability to guide me pilot through the knowledge and practical requirements built confidence, perhaps the most important trait a pilot can have. I wholeheartedly recommend Aaron for any pilot looking for a primary or advanced rating.</p>

                    <p class="edoardo_text">Learning how to fly a plane is no big deal. Becoming a pilot, though, is a completely different matter. Choosing an experienced CFI is crucial in order to be prepared to handle, with the right level of confidence, the whole range of different situations you will encounter in your life as a pilot. Thats why I'm glad I met Aaron and got my Private Pilot license with him. I have no doubt of my instructor choice for the Instrument Rating. I can't wait to start!</p>
